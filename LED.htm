    <h3 id = "Origins">The Origins</h3>
    <p>The Combat Ready Light Show was born in the summer of 2015 when the innovative thinkers of team BUINVENT realized that
        light shows needed improvement. LED light shows were in high demand and a good one was impossible to find. Consequently,
        The Combat Ready Light Show was inspired and development began.</p>

    <h3 id = "Hardware">The Hardware</h3>
    <p>The light show consists of 168 LED's powered by an Arduino Mega and an Arduino mini. A catalex mp3 player is used for
        playing the audio. LED driving is done through NPN transistors hooked up to a 5 volt external power source.

    <h3 id = "Software">The Software</h3>
    <p>Because there were two arduinos, there were two sets of software that needed to be written.
